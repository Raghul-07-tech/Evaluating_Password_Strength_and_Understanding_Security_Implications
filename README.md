# üîê Evaluating Password Strength and Understanding Security Implications

## üìå Task-Based Steps

### 1. Created Passwords with Different Complexity

Passwords tested:
- `password123`
- `Pa$$w0rd!`
- `u7N#eG1@Lp0`
- `Abcdefgh`
- `P@55!W0rD_2025`

---

### 2. Used Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations

| Password             | Elements Used                    |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `password123`        | lowercase, numbers               |
| `Pa$$w0rd!`          | uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols |
| `u7N#eG1@Lp0`        | uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols |
| `Abcdefgh`           | uppercase, lowercase             |
| `P@55!W0rD_2025`     | all types + long length          |

### 3. Tested Passwords on [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)

| Password            | Score (%) | Strength       | Tool Feedback Highlights                          |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `password123`       | ~26%      | Very Weak      | Common, lacks symbols, sequential digits          |
| `Pa$$w0rd!`         | ~45%      | Medium         | Better mix, but predictable word base             |
| `u7N#eG1@Lp0`       | ~88%      | Very Strong    | Excellent variety and randomness                  |
| `Abcdefgh`          | ~29%      | Weak           | No digits or symbols, short and guessable         |
| `P@55!W0rD_2025`    | ~90%      | Very Strong    | High complexity and sufficient length             |

### 4. Noted Scores and Feedback from the Tool

#### Common Suggestions:
- ‚ùå Avoid repeated characters and sequences (`abc`, `123`)
- ‚ùå Avoid dictionary words (like `password`)
- ‚úÖ Include at least one uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol
- ‚úÖ Use 12+ characters with unpredictable structure

---

### 5. Identified Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12 characters**
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words**, personal info, or common patterns
- Place **symbols/numbers in the middle**, not just ends
- Use **password managers** to generate and store complex passwords

---

### 6. Tips Learned from the Evaluation

- Longer and more complex passwords are significantly harder to crack
- Avoid passwords that follow keyboard patterns or sequences
- Unpredictability is key ‚Äî randomness beats memorability
- Always test passwords with tools like [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)

---

### 7. Researched Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type         | Description                              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**     | Tries all possible combinations          |
| **Dictionary Attack** | Uses common words and phrases          |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Uses leaked credentials from breaches |
| **Phishing**        | Tricks users into revealing passwords    |

---

### 8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security

| Complexity Level      | Protection Level | Time to Crack (Estimated)   |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Simple (`password123`) | üö® Very Low      | Instant                      |
| Moderate (`Abcdefgh`)  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low           | Seconds                      |
| Strong (`Pa$$w0rd!`)   | ‚úÖ Medium         | Minutes                      |
| Very Strong (`u7N#eG1@Lp0`) | üü¢ High     | Years                        |

## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion

The evaluation clearly shows that **password complexity drastically improves security**.  
To protect against common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks:
- Always use **long**, **complex**, and **unique passwords**
- Validate passwords using tools like [PasswordMeter](https://passwordmeter.com)
- Store credentials securely using **password managers**
